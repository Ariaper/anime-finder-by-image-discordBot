# anime-finder-by-image-discordBot

I made a discord bot using node.js and trace.moe api for myself. You can download or use my code.

## how to use?
* first choose your image ready for uploading to your server and then write this command in the image caption: !searchanime
* then bot will respond with the anime title and info.
+ **notice** that 1 image allowed per request.
* Example:

Good luck.
